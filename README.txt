This is a personal R package, with functions that I've found myself copying and pasting into various scripts a lot, and I think it would be easier to have them loaded into a single package.

This package can be installed into R using the following code:

devtools::install_git('https://github.com/kennybolster/kbolster')
library(kbolster)
